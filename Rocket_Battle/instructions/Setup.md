Making the Game Title
---------------------

The game title displays in the window title bar.  It currently says
"Your programs name here".  Let change it.  Find "Your programs name here"
in the file (near the top) and change to the words you want to show.

For example, if my game title is "Rocket Fight", I would change the line
to say:

    programName = "Rocket Fight"
