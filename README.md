## About

This repo contains a few starter pygame kits. Each kit contains a start.py file, a finish.py file, a myLibrary.py file, images directory, and an instruction directory.  Each start.py is a minimal implementation of a game.  The finish.py is a fully implemented version of said game. Each start.py file can be modified, by following the instructions in the instructions directory, to become like the finish.py.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and open the folder in an IDE and run start.py

Alternatively, navigate to one of the kits via Command Line and run: **python start.py**
